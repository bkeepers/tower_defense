  # you can move to from this node without crossing any other nodes. For
  # example, if your nodes are squares on a grid, the neighbors would be the
  # squares immediately up, down, left, and right. (If you permit diagonal
  # movement, the neighbors would also include the squares immediately up-left,
  # up-right, down-left, and down-right.)

  # Optionally overriden by your AStarNode subclass. Return the cost of moving

  # Finds the shortest path from this node to +goal+. Returns a two-element
  # array. The first element is the total cost of the path (which will be equal
  # to the length of the path if you don't override movement_cost). The second
  # element is an array containing all of the nodes in the path. The path array
  # will include this node and +goal+.
  #
  # If there is no path between this node and +goal+, the total cost and the
  # path array will both be nil (i.e., the method returns <tt>[nil, nil]</tt>).
  #
  # Note that it is not entirely accurate to say that this method finds *the*
  # shortest path, because it may be possible to traverse the least-cost 
  # distance between two nodes along more than one route. The particular path
  # returned by this method is related non-trivially to your node class' hash
  # and guess_distance methods. Changing either of these methods will cause a
  # different path to be selected when multiple paths have the least cost, but
  # not in a way that is predictable in the general case.
